ost_final_rank
==============

The goal of the final project is to demonstrate your knowledge of Open Source tools. In assignment 3, we wrote a command line tool to rank items, and in assignment 4, we put together a simple web-based interface to this system. For the final project, we will adapt this into a more full featured web-based application.
